CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findxtypes.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "xtypes", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "xtypes" with any
  of the following names:

    xtypesConfig.cmake
    xtypes-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "xtypes" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "xtypes_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "xtypes"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
